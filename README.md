* `Explict` & `Explict2`: demonstrations of explicit animations to independently animate different aspects of a view
* `Transition`: a playground showing the use of `AnyTransition` to animate views in and out of the view hierarchy
* `MatchedGeometryEffect`: a playground showing how to perform a sematic move between different nodes in the view hierarchy by using a `matchedGeometryEffect`
* `AnimatableModifier`: a custom sine wave and color interpolating `AnimatableModifier`
